### Development

To run the application in development mode, use the following command:

This will start the development server and compile your code. You can access the application in your browser at (http://localhost:5173).

The development server supports hot module replacement (HMR), which means you can see the changes in real-time without refreshing the page.

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate optimized and minified production-ready files in the `dist` directory.

You can then deploy the contents of the `dist` directory to your hosting environment.

### Additional Scripts

This template comes with some additional scripts that you can use:

- `npm run lint`: Run the linter to check for code style and formatting issues.
- `npm run test`: Run the test suite for the application.
